mg
==

A a minimalist way to create [gems](http://rubygems.org) and publish
them to [Rubyforge](http://rubyforge.org) using
[Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org).

Usage
-----

In your Rakefile:


    begin
      require "mg"
      MG.new("foo.gemspec")
    rescue
      def abort_without_mg; abort "To use this task: gem install sr-mg";end
      task :install do; abort_without_mg; end
      task :package do; abort_without_mg; end
      task :rubyforge do; abort_without_mg; end
      namespace :rubyforge do
        task :gem do; abort_without_mg; end
        task :git do; abort_without_mg; end
      end
    end
	

The following tasks are now available:

    rake install
      Build and install as local gem

    rake package
      Build gem tarball into dist/

    rake rubyforge
      Publish the current release on Rubyforge

    rake rubyforge:gem
      Publish gem and tarball to rubyforge

    rake rubyforge:git
      Push to gitosis@rubyforge.org:foo.git
